# We store a local copy of the swarm client to eliminate our dependency

# This will execute the client portion of the Jenkins swarm plugin,
# causing this AWS instance to connect back to the Jenkins master node.
# We want this command to continue running "forever", but we don't want
# to block any Ansible playbooks from continuing after executing this
# command.
#
# The "poll" value used allows us to "fire and forget", and keeps us
# from waiting for the command to exit. Unfortunately, there isn't a
# good way to execute the command such that it'll run "forever"; Ansible
# requires a duration for the command to run in the form of the "async"
# parameter. To workaround this, we just specify an arbitrary maximum
# time for the command to run of 7 weeks (these slaves are used on a
# per-job basis, so I don't expect any single build to take more than 7
# weeks to complete).
#
# To make it easier to use this role with the "deploy_role.py" program
# (e.g. during development) this task is only run if the "jenkins_name"
# variable is specified. Since this variable doesn't have a default
# value, if this role is applied to a host using "deploy_role.py"
# without explicitly providing a value for this variable, this task will
# not be executed (which is usually the intended behavior). As a result,
# this can make it harder to realize when this variable was not
# specified when it actually should have been (e.g. from "production"
# Ansible playbooks); this is an acceptable trade off.
#
# Also note, we specifically run the Jenkins swarm client as a non-root
# user because the illumos build will fail if the build is run as root.
# Thus, we drop down to the delphix user when running the swarm client;
# this will ensure any commands run through Jenkins will be run as the
# delphix user. Otherwise the client would run as the "ansible_ssh_user"
# which could potentially be root.
